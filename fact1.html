            "Fishing is an intrinsic part of Iceland's history and heritage. Since the country was first settled, Icelandic <br>
             fishermen have braved the seas to bring home their catch. Fish was both an important source of food, and laid <br>
             the foundation of our economy. Respect for the ocean and its gifts is deeply ingrained in our culture, and the <br>
             responsible management of marine resources is of a fundamental importance to the nation."
