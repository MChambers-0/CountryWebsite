            "It is common knowledge that Icelandic people are superstitious by nature. I was raised in <br>
             a family where the Elves were a part of the landscape and life in general. My mother used to <br>
              tell me stories about the elves she played with when she was growing up. There was even <br>
               one elf story related to when I was born, but Iâ€™m going to save that for our Reykjavik Folklore Walking <br>
                Tour together."
